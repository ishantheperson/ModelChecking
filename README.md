# Synchronous Model Checking


## Dependencies

 - Parsec (should be included with Haskell)
 - GHC version > 8 is preferred. 
 - Also needs collections > 0.5.11 (included with GHC version > 8)

Otherwise should be none. 

## Usage

See `src/SampleModel.hs`. Currently I am working on making the code more modular and making it easier to add new structure implementations. Right now presburger arithmetic is hardcoded in.
